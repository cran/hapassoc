Description: The following R functions are used for inference of trait
        associations with haplotypes and other covariates in
        generalized linear models.  The functions are developed
        primarily for data collected in cohort or cross-sectional
        studies. They can accommodate uncertain haplotype phase and
        handle missing genotypes at some SNPs.
